# Useful buddhist teachings

We are naturally free and unconditioned. We are intrinsically enlightened and lack nothing.	*~ Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche - paraphrased*
{:.keep-together}

***

Within the sky-like empty mind, habitual tendencies and disturbing emotions are just like clouds and mist. When they appear they appear within the expanse of empty mind. When they remain they remain within the expanse of empty mind. And when they dissolve they dissolve in that same expanse of empty mind. *~ Guru Rinpoche*

***

Alert, alert, yet relax, relax.	*~ Ma Chik Lap Drön. 1055-1149*
{:.keep-together}

***

It is important that we check ourselves to see that our mind is free from disturbing emotions. If we do not check our own minds then we see only what is outside ourselves, noticing only what faults others have made while remaining unaware of our own. *~ Penor Rinpoche (paraphrased)*
{:.keep-together}

***

We have to recognize the tremendous opportunity that we have. As humans we have this rare intelligence but there is a danger that we will waste it. Death is certain but when we will die is totally unpredictable. We could lose our precious human existence at any moment. With such reflections we must motivate ourselves to do something meaningful right now. The best way to make your human existence meaningful is to engage in the practice of Dharma. During meditation and in between be mindful and introspectively vigilant. Keep watch on your mind.

To work with changes now in this life is the way to prepare for death. Life may be full of pain, suffering and difficulty but all of these are opportunities that can help us move toward an emotional acceptance of death. It is only when we believe things to be permanent that we shut off the possibility of learning from change.	*~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

***


When you feel lonely on the path remember that all the enlightened beings are always with you. You are never alone.	*~ Chamtrul Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

The moment of death is a tremendous opportunity if we understand clearly what is happening and have prepared well for it in life. At the actual moment of death the thinking ego-mind dies into the essence and in this truth, enlightenment takes place. If we familiarize ourselves with the true nature of mind through practice while we are alive we become more prepared for when it reveals itself spontaneously at the moment of death. Recognition then follows as naturally as a child running into its mother’s lap. Remaining in that state we are liberated. *~ Sogyal Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

It is our mind, and that alone, that chains us or sets us free.	*~ Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

The fully ripened effect of our actions will come to each of us. We are therefore not above depending on what we do in this life. *~ Kangyur Rinpoche - paraphrased*
{:.keep-together}

***

When the sun of fierce devotion shines on the snow mountain of the Buddha the stream of his blessing pours down. *~ The Tibetan Saint, Drikung Kyobpa*
{:.keep-together}

***

Those who believe they have plenty of time get ready only at the time of death. Then it may be too late and they are ravaged by regret. *~ Padmasambhava*
{:.keep-together}

***

Realization is not knowledge about the universe but the living experience of the nature of the universe. Until we have such living experience we remain dependent on examples and subject to their limits.	*~ Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

Searching for happiness outside is like trying to catch a rainbow. *~ Chamtrul Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

It is our mind, and that alone, that chains us or sets us free. *~ Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

What is the right inner environment of the mind? All effort and struggle come from not being spacious. Creating the right environment is necessary for Rigpa, your unborn awareness and natural mind to be present. With humor and spaciousness Rigpa arises effortlessly.
{:.keep-together}

***

The power to attain stability by just recognizing the nature of mind is like a torch which in one instant can clear away the darkness of aeons. If we can recognize the nature of mind in the bardo of death there is not the slightest doubt that we will attain enlightenment. From this very moment on we should become familiar with the nature of mind through practice. *~ Padmasambhava*

***

Mind, which is like lightning, a breeze, or passing clouds, is coloured by its various thoughts of everything under the sun, but when examined thoroughly is found to lack a basis or origin. Just like a mirage on the horizon, it is devoid of essential nature. While being empty, it appears; and while appearing, it is empty.	*~ Mipham Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

We might have boundless knowledge, all derived from study and reflection, but if our fundamental character is not attuned to the Dharma we will not tame the enemy, the afflictive emotions. *~ Longchenpa*
{:.keep-together}

***

Dzogchen meditation is subtly powerful in dealing with the arisings of the mind and has a unique perspective on them. All the risings are seen in their true nature, not as separate from Rigpa, unborn awareness, natural mind, and not as antagonistic to it, but actually as none other—and this is very important—than its “self-radiance,” the manifestation of its very energy. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

***

When the wisdom of Rigpa, natural unborn awareness, appears a sense of unshakable certainty that “this is it” rises up. There is nothing further to seek, nothing more that could possibly be hoped for. Once you have recognized your natural mind your familiarity with it will be deepened through glimpse after glimpse of its nature. Eventually you will be able to maintain it in any situation. Your awareness of it can be further strengthened and stabilized through the practice of meditation. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*

From the blossoming lotus of devotion at the center of my being, rise up, compassionate Buddha, my refuge. To protect me from misfortune remain as the jewel-ornament on the crown of my head, the mandala of great bliss, arousing my mindfulness and awareness. *~ JikMé Lingpa*

Mind, which is like lightning, a breeze, or passing clouds, is coloured by its various thoughts of everything under the sun, but when examined thoroughly is found to lack a basis or origin. Just like a mirage on the horizon it is devoid of essential nature. While being empty, it appears, and while appearing, it is empty. *~ Mipham Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

Whenever doubt arises, see it simply as an obstacle, recognize it as an understanding that is calling out to be clarified or unblocked, and know that it is not a fundamental problem but simply a stage in the process of purification and learning. Allow the process to continue and complete itself, and never lose your trust or resolve. This is the way followed by all the great practitioners of the past, who used to say: “There is no armor like perseverance.” *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*
{:.keep-together}

***

Some people say that they are too busy to practice the Dharma but if they want to, they can turn every aspect of their life to the path, no matter where they are, or what they are doing. It is okay to be busy. But be busy with the Dharma. *~ Chamtrul Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

Every moment of your life provides an opportunity to practice, no matter where you are or what is happening. Do not keep practice as just something that is done in a dharma centre or in front of a shrine or on your meditation seat. Let the whole world and all that you encounter within it become the training ground for your mind. The more that you do this the faster you will move on the path to buddhahood and the happier you will become on the way.	*~ Chamtrul Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

The root of all phenomena is the mind. If unexamined, it rushes after experiences, ingenious in the games of deception. If you look right into it, it is free of any ground or origin, In essence free of any coming, staying or going. *~ Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö*
{:.keep-together}

***

A direct reflection on what death means and the many facets of the truth of impermanence can enable us to make rich use of this life while we still have time, and ensure that when we die it will be without remorse or self-recrimination at having wasted our lives.	As Tibet’s famous poet-saint, Milarepa, said: “My religion is to live—and die—without regret.”
{:.keep-together}

***

The basis on which a Buddhist accepts the concept of rebirth is principally the continuity of consciousness... If you trace our present mind or consciousness back, then you will find that you are tracing the origin of the continuity of mind into an infinite dimension; it is, as you will see, beginningless.	Therefore there must be successive rebirths that allow that continuum of mind to be there.
{:.keep-together}

***

When the world is filled with evil transform all mishaps into the path of enlightenment. *~ Tibetan Buddhist proverb.*
{:.keep-together}

***

“Training” the mind does not in any way mean forcibly subjugating or brainwashing the mind. To train the mind is first to see directly and concretely how the mind functions, a knowledge that you derive from spiritual teachings and through personal experience in meditation practice. Then you use that understanding to tame the mind and work with it skillfully, to make it more and more pliable, so that you can become master of your mind and employ it to its fullest and most beneficial end. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Rest in great natural peace, this exhausted mind, beaten helpless by karma and neurotic thoughts, like the relentless fury of the pounding waves in the infinite ocean of samsara. Rest in great natural peace.	*~ Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche*

Someone who has acted carelessly, But later becomes careful and attentive, Is as beautiful as the bright moon emerging from the clouds. *~ Nagarjuna*
{:.keep-together}

***

Do the difficult things while they are easy and the great things while they are small.￼ *~ Lao Tsu*
{:.keep-together}

***

Profound and tranquil, free from complexity, uncompounded luminous clarity, beyond conceptual ideas. This is the depth of the mind of those that have conquered. In this mind there is nothing to be removed nor anything that needs to be added. It is merely the immaculate looking naturally at itself. *~ Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

We are so addicted to looking outside ourselves that we have lost access to our inner being. We are terrified to look inward, because our culture has given us no idea of what we will find. We make our lives so hectic that we eliminate the slightest risk of looking into ourselves. Even the idea of meditation can scare us. When we hear the words egoless or emptiness we think that experiencing those states will be like being thrown out the door of a spaceship to float forever in a dark, chilling void. Nothing could be further from the truth. In a world filled with distraction know your natural mind and find stillness in the storm. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

***


The Buddhist teachings can help us find what we need to realize but we have to go on our own journey with them to come to a personal realization. That journey may take us through suffering, difficulties, and doubts of all kinds, but they can become our greatest teachers. Through them we can discover the inner strength and fearlessness we need to emerge from our old habits and set patterns and the resilience to stay with the freedom opened up to us by the teachings. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

***

In horror of death, I took to the mountains Again and again I meditated on the uncertainty of the hour of death, Capturing the fortress of the deathless unending nature of mind Now all fear of death is over and done. *~ Milarepa*
{:.keep-together}

***

When your attitude changes then the whole atmosphere of your mind changes, even the very nature of your thoughts and emotions. When you become more agreeable, then they do; if you have no difficulty with them, they will have no difficulty with you either. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*
{:.keep-together}

***


Negative experiences are the most misleading, because we tend to take them as a bad sign, but in fact negative experiences can be blessings in disguise. Try to not react to them with aversion as you might normally do, but recognize them instead for what they truly are, merely experiences, illusory and dreamlike. The realization of the true nature of the experience liberates you from the harm or danger of the experience itself and as a result a negative experience can become a source of great blessing and accomplishment. There are innumerable stories of how masters worked like this with negative experiences and transformed them into catalysts for realization.
{:.keep-together}

***


The easiest way to get into a state of meditation is by listening. Don’t think of what was or what is going to be. Rest in the present and let your senses be aware of what is happening now. Listen to the sounds around you, the sounds outside. Identify the sound nearest you, the sounds in the middle and those furthest away, those that are loudest and those you can barely hear.
{:.keep-together}

***

Don’t shut off your pain. Your pain and sorrow can be a priceless gift, your chance of discovering, through spiritual practice what lies beyond. “Grief,” Rumi wrote, “can be the garden of compassion. If you keep your heart open through everything, your pain can become your greatest ally in your life’s search for love and wisdom.” *~ Rigpa Glmpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

***


When you love others you wish for their happiness. As our minds are one if you love others it will pervade their minds and they will thus feel happy. Love is the only cause of happiness. Its nature is all pervasive like space. Love is the sunlight of the mind. *~ Garchen Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

When you arrive naturally at a state of meditation you can remain there for a long time without any distraction or special effort. There is nothing called “meditation” to protect or sustain, for you are in the natural flow of the wisdom of Rigpa. And you realize, when you are in it, that is how it has always been, and is. When the wisdom of Rigpa shines, not one shadow of doubt can remain, and a deep, complete understanding arises, effortlessly and directly. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*
{:.keep-together}

***


People would often come to see master Jamyang Khyentse simply to ask for his guidance for the moment of death. He was so loved and revered throughout Tibet, especially in the eastern province of Kham, that some would travel for months on end to meet him and get his blessing just once before they died. This was his advice for what is needed as you live and especially when you come to die:	“Be free of attachment and aversion. Keep your mind pure. And unite your mind with Buddha.”
{:.keep-together}

***

When you have fully recognized that the nature of your mind is the same as that of a buddha from then on you and your buddha nature can never be separate. Your buddha nature is one with the nature of your mind, always present, as it is.	When you have recognized that your buddha nature and you are inseparable an enormous gratitude and sense of awe and homage is born in you. Dudjom Rinpoche calls this “the homage of the View.” It is a devotion that springs spontaneously from seeing the View of the nature of mind.
{:.keep-together}

***

Visualize a situation where you feel you have acted badly and about which you feel guilty. As you breathe in accept total responsibility for your actions without trying to justify your behavior. As you breathe out, send out reconciliation, forgiveness, healing, understanding, love and compassion for yourself and the person you feel you may have harmed. Breathe in blame and breathe out the undoing of harm. Breathe in responsibility and breathe out healing, forgiveness and reconciliation.	*~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

***


Falling under the influence of misguided people and wrong views not only destroys the merit you have accumulated in the past but also blocks your path to freedom in the future. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

***

Pure awareness of nowness is the real buddha. In openness and contentment find the buddha in your heart. When you realize that unending natural mind is the very nature of the buddha then there is no need for attachment, grasping, weeping prayers or artificial complaints. By simply relaxing in an uncontrived, open, and natural state obtain the blessing of aimless self-liberation of whatever arises. *~ Dudjom Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

As our minds open to the vast, existence of the nature of mind we begin to glimpse a different dimension, one in which our assumptions about our identity and reality which we thought we knew so well start to dissolve. It is easy to see then that the possibility of lives other than this one becomes at least possible. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

***


At all times do not lose courage in your inner awareness. Uplift yourself while assuming a humble position in your outer demeanor. Follow the example of the life and complete liberation of previous accomplished masters. Do not blame your past karma, instead be someone who purely and flawlessly practices the dharma. Do not blame temporary negative circumstances, instead be someone who remains steadfast in the face of whatever circumstances may arise. *~ Dudjom Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

Life is a continuing dance of birth and death, a dance of change. Every time you hear the rush of a mountain stream or the waves crashing on the shore or your own heartbeat, hear the sound of impermanence. These changes, these small deaths, are our living links with death. They are death’s pulses, death’s heartbeat, prompting us to let go of all the things we cling to and to live in the moments of our unborn awareness, our natural mind. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*

Getting butter from milk is only possible because milk already contains cream. No one ever made butter by churning water. The prospector looks for gold in rocks and not in wood chips. Likewise, the quest for perfect enlightenment only makes sense because buddha-nature is already present in every being. Without that nature, all efforts would be futile. *~ Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye*
{:.keep-together}

***

Ignorance of our true nature is the root of suffering and the root of ignorance is the mind’s habitual tendency to distraction. To end the mind’s distraction is to end suffering itself. Meditation helps bring the mind home to its true nature. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*
{:.keep-together}

***

When you meditate, there should be no effort to control and no attempt to be peaceful. Don’t be solemn or feel that you are taking part in some special ritual. Don’t impose anything on the mind. Let go even of the idea that you are meditating. Let your body remain as it is, and your breath as you find it. Think of yourself as the sky, holding the whole universe. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

As Buddhists our goal in this life time is to use the opportunity diligently to practice the Dharma so as to benefit all sentient beings. *~ Khenpo Tsultrim Longpa*

If Shakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment, so can you! No matter how insignificant you feel, no matter what problems you have and no matter how many afflictive emotions fill your mind never underestimate your potential for a single moment. Like a diamond covered by dirt your buddha nature is there, waiting to be discovered. *~ Chamtrul Rinpoche*
{:.keep-together}

***

Looking into death need not be frightening or morbid. Reflect on death when you are inspired, relaxed, and comfortable, lying in bed or on vacation, walking in nature or listening to music. Reflect on it when you are happy, in good health, confident, and full of well-being. There are moments when you will find yourself naturally inspired to introspection. Work with them gently. These are the moments when you can go through a powerful experience and you can quickly change. These are the moments when former beliefs can crumble on their own and you can find yourself transformed, in which brilliant insights can change your view and your destiny. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

Just as a deep lake is clear and still so by following the dharma the wise become peaceful. *~ The Buddha*

If your mind is empty it is always ready for anything and it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few. *~ Suzuki Roshi*
{:.keep-together}

***

Be at ease with natural and spacious openness. Release ambition and grasping and relax in the emptiness of natural mind. Allow anxiety and aggression to melt in the sunlight of unborn awareness. Rest in the mindfulness of calm abiding and awaken the insight of clear light. Let negativity go, aggression dissolve and confusion evaporate like mist in the vast and stainless sky of buddha nature. *~ Rigpa Glmpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

How can we overcome attachment to our environment, culture, society, family, friends, our country, the world and everything that surrounds us and accept change? The law of impermanence is that everything is always changing including our physical, mental and emotional forms and mental constructs but our unborn awareness and buddha nature always remain the same. When we drop our ego and attachment and unmask our unborn awareness and buddha nature of love for self and others we can accept impermanence as if we were the sky looking at the clouds of our grasping and delusion parting and dispersing. The wisdom of our true compassionate heart can come shining out like the sun. With knowledge, wisdom and faith we become comfortable with uncertainty, accept change and rest in the strength of our true selves. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*

Overcome your uncertainties and free yourself from dwelling on sorrow. When you delight in existence you will become a guide to those in need revealing the path to many. *~ Siddhartha Gautama*

I refrain from harmful speech action thoughts and emotions. I accept groundlessness and uncertainty. I enjoy and embrace the journey and leave the fulfillment of the goal to my good fortune. I accept my destiny and I embrace the dream of my existence. *~ Pema Chodron*
{:.keep-together}

***

I notice and acknowledge when I find myself trying to escape the fundamental uncertainty of life. I notice my habitual ways and my efforts not to be present and to escape into old patterns. I see when I am about to exit and then I make a conscious decision not to do it. I resist over eating and zoning out. I stay present at all times. *~ Pema Chodron*
{:.keep-together}

In the Dzogchen teachings your meditation and your gaze should be like the vast expanse of a great ocean: all-pervading, open, and limitless. Just as your View and posture are inseparable, so your meditation inspires your gaze, and they now merge as one. Do not focus on anything in particular; instead, turn back into yourself slightly, and let your gaze expand and become more and more spacious and pervasive. You will discover that your vision becomes more expansive and that there is more peace, more compassion in your gaze, more equanimity, and more poise.

Whatever joy there is in this world comes from desiring others to be happy and whatever suffering there is in this world comes from desiring myself to be happy. *~ Shantideva*
{:.keep-together}

***

Renunciation has both sadness and joy in it, sadness because you realize the futility of your old ways and joy because of the greater vision that begins to unfold when you are able to let go of them. It is a joy that gives birth to a new and profound strength, a confidence, an abiding inspiration that comes from the realization that you are not condemned to your habits, that you can indeed emerge from them, that you can change, and grow more and more free. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*
{:.keep-together}

***

If we have to make a choice between outer pleasure and comfort, and inner freedom, peace and ultimate happiness, we should choose inner freedom, peace and ultimate happiness. If we can find that within the outer will take care of itself. *~ Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche*

***

Spiritual truth is not something elaborate and esoteric, it is in fact profound common sense. When you realize the nature of mind layers of confusion peel away. You don’t actually “become” a buddha, you simply cease slowly to be deluded. And being a buddha is not being some omnipotent spiritual superman, but becoming at last a true human being. *~ Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche*

We are visitors on this planet. We are here for ninety or one hundred years at the very most. During that period, we must try to do something good, something useful, with our lives. If you contribute to other people's happiness, you will find the true goal, the true meaning of life. *~ His Holiness the Dalai Lama*

To meditate is to make a complete break with how we operate in the world of samsara. It is a space free of all cares and concerns. There is no competition, no desire to possess or grasp at anything, no intense and anxious struggle, and no hunger to achieve. It is ambition-less with neither acceptance ir rejection, hope or fear. We release all those emotions and concepts that have imprisoned us into a space of natural simplicity where with a heart of compassion and our natural unborn awareness our buddha nature manifests. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

Always recognize the dreamlike qualities of life and reduce attachment and aversion. Have positive intention. Practice good-heartedness towards all beings. Be loving and compassionate, no matter what others do to you. This is true spirituality. *~ Chakdud Tulku Rinpoche*

When you find yourself in a deep state of stillness, Rigpa or natural mind, often it does not last very long as a thought or a movement arises like a wave in the ocean. Don’t reject the movement or embrace the stillness but continue the flow of your pure presence. The pervasive, peaceful state of the stillness is the Rigpa itself and all risings are none other than this Rigpa’s self-radiance. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*
{:.keep-together}

***

Our conditioned ego mind prevents us from breaking through to the skylike nature of our natural unborn awareness. We may may have glimpses of it but we need to break out of the bounds of our conditioned ego mind altogether to discover and let in the fresh air of Rigpa, the simple direct seeing of our natural unconditioned buddha mind.

Rigpa, that empty knowing is always present. Just recognize the knowing that is present in whatever situation you are in, that’s what you are, that knowing. You are not the body, you are not the mind, you are not the ego, you are the knowing that is present in whatever situation you are in. You are not the me. When a strong sense of me arises, the ego, there is something that is knowing that, the Rigpa. That knowing that is always present, nothing changes or alters it. When you recognise that, ah, that sense of ego dissolves. When you recognise that, knowing that you are the knowing, non conceptually, that is what Rigpa is. *~ Kenneth Thornton*

Listen to the sounds around you instead of the constant stream of your thoughts. Listen to the sounds furthest away, listen to the sounds nearest you. Listen to the sounds individually and all together. When your thoughts have been replaced with the sounds nds around you pick a positive affirmation such as “I love myself and I love my life” and repeat it silently to yourself a few times. Become aware of each part of your body starting from your right hand, each finger, then the palm of your hand, then scan each part of your body and become aware of your body as a whole. Maintain a state of silent awareness of yourself and everything around you. Don’t suppress thoughts and don’t follow them, become aware of them as they arise and let them go. *~ Bodhi Nidra*

Whatever we do it is the mind that is most important. This is why the Buddhist teachings focus on perfecting the mind. The mind is king and body and speech are servants which must do its bidding. It is the mind that conceives faith and the mind that conceives doubt; it is the mind that conceives love and the mind that conceives hatred. *~ Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche*

Now when the bardo (transition period) of this life is dawning upon me I abandon laziness for which life has no time.

By relaxing in the nature of mind and becoming familiar with it through meditation practice we will be prepared for the time when it reveals itself spontaneously and powerfully at the moment of death.

The meaning of the karmic law of cause and effect means we must take responsibility not only for our own health and happiness but also everyone else’s health and happiness, for benefiting ourselves and others. Karma does not mean we are unable to help ourselves or move forward. The meaning of the karmic law of cause and effect means we should be even more confident and enthusiastic about taking on responsibility for helping self and others. *~ The Karmapa.*

From a Buddhist point of view, the actual experience of death is very important. Although how or where we will be reborn is generally dependent on karmic forces, our state of mind at the time of death can influence the quality of our next rebirth. So at the moment of death, in spite of the great variety of karmas we have accumulated, if we make a special effort to generate a virtuous state of mind, we may strengthen and activate a virtuous karma, and so bring about a happy rebirth. *~ The Dalai Lama*

Wrong views and wrong convictions are the most devastating of all our delusions. Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot were convinced that they were right and we all have that same delusional tendency as they had to form convictions, believe them without question, and act on them, so bringing down suffering not only on ourselves but on all those around us. The heart of Buddha’s teaching is to see the actual state of things, as they are, a complete perspective on the nature of mind and reality, a view that has the wisdom of the meaning of this life and all those that are to follow. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*

Emotions like anger, desire, anxiety, fear, panic, depression or elation come like the waves of the ocean. See them not as a disturbance or an obstacle but as an opportunity. Do not react to arisings such as these with habitual tendencies of attachment and aversion. To react to emotions in this way empowers them and binds you even tighter in the chains of delusion. See right through them, as soon as they arise, to what they really are, the vivid and electric manifestation of the energy of life itself. If you do this even the most turbulent emotions will fail to seize hold of you and instead dissolve, as wild waves rise and rear and sink back into the calm of the ocean. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*

In the samsara of everyday life we spend our lives chasing our thoughts and emotions.

Relax in your natural mind, your unborn primordial awareness. Connect with the love and compassion for self and others of your innate buddha nature which we all possess. Become familiar with it and make it your foundation and refuge.

Life is a perpetual fluctuation of birth, death and transition. Bardo (transition) experiences are happening to us all the time. Normally we are oblivious to the bardos and their gaps as our mind passes from one so-called solid situation to the next, ignoring the transitions that are constantly occurring. Every moment of our experience is a bardo as each thought and each emotion arises out of and dies back into the essence of mind. It is in moments of strong change and transition that the true skylike, primordial nature of mind has a chance to manifest. Watching our mind we can become aware of the transitions and our natural mind and find wisdom and rest in its unborn primordial nature. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*

At the moment of death our state of mind is all-important. If we die in a positive frame of mind we can improve our next birth despite our negative karma. And if we are upset and distressed it may have a detrimental effect, even though we may have used our lives well. This means that the last thought and emotion that we have before we die has an extremely powerful determining effect on our immediate future. This is why the masters stress that the quality of the atmosphere around us when we die is crucial. With our friends and relatives we should do all we can to inspire positive emotions and sacred feelings like love, compassion, and devotion, and do all we can to help them to let go of grasping, yearning, and attachment. *~ Sogyal Rinpoche - Tibetan Book of Living and Dying*

When you feel estranged from those in pain or bitter or despairing it helps you to reveal the loving, expansive radiance of your own true nature.

Belief in the ego is the absence of true knowledge of who we and others really are. In Tibetan, ego is called dakdzin, which means “grasping to a self.” Such grasping is futile and condemned to frustration. The ego is a construction and believing in it a delusion. When we identify with our ego we are identifying with something that does not inherently exist. From our belief that we are our ego, from our efforts to protect it and our ignorance of our true self spring all our fundamental insecurities and fears. Our true self is beyond the ego projection of who we are that we have developed to deal with the world.

In meditation start with calm abiding meditation, known as Shamarha meditation in Tibetan Buddhism. Relax the mind. Don’t follow thoughts but don’t repress them, just let them go.

In the Dzogchen tradition of Tibetan Buddhism Rigpa or The View is the realization of the nature of mind, and the nature of reality. When the View is there completely there is not the slightest trace of doubt. It is looking at reality through its own eyes. Until we reach enlightenment there will be doubts, because doubt is a fundamental activity of the unenlightened mind. The way to deal with doubts is neither to suppress nor indulge them. When the View is realized they will disappear. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*

Just how the sun shines on to this world without ever discriminating, the compassionate energy of all of the buddhas pervades everything. No matter where you are, no matter what you do, it is always there.

The more that your mind opens, the greater the blessings that will fuel your practice all of the way to liberation and enlightenment. *~ Chamtrul Rinpoche*

Now, at this moment, reading this seems vividly real to you but this page will soon be only a memory. The law of impermanence will always remain whether we realize or remember it or not.

Realizing the View of Rigpa subtly but completely transforms your vision of everything. Thoughts and concepts are all that block us from always being in the absolute. Do not to create hope and fear for they only engender more mental gossip. When the View is there thoughts are seen for what they truly are, fleeting, transparent and only relative. You do not cling to thoughts and emotions or reject them. You welcome them all within the vast embrace of Rigpa. The things you took so seriously before—ambitions, plans, expectations, doubts, and passions—no longer have any deep hold on you. The View will help you to see the futility and pointlessness of them all. You will find the spirit of true renunciation. *~ Sogyal Rinpoche paraphrased*

Every single negative thing we have ever thought or done has ultimately arisen from our grasping at a false self and our cherishing of that false self, making it the dearest and most important element in our lives.

You can think of the nature of mind like a mirror, with five different powers or “wisdoms.” Its openness and vastness is the “wisdom of all-encompassing space,” the womb of compassion.

The meditation on the nature of mind is actually very easy, as we do not have to go anywhere to find this nature. No work needs to be done to produce it. No effort is required to find it.

Is karma really so hard to see in operation? Don’t we only have to look back at our own lives to see clearly the consequences of some of our actions? When we upset or hurt someone didn’t it rebound on us? Were we not left with a bitter and dark memory, and the shadows of self-disgust? That memory and those shadows are karma. Our habits and our fears too are also due to karma, the results of our past actions, words, and thoughts. If we examine our actions, and become really mindful of them we will see that there is a pattern that repeats itself. Whenever we act negatively, it leads to pain and suffering and whenever we act positively, it eventually results in happiness. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

When practicing meditation it’s important not to get involved in mental commentary, analysis, or internal gossip. Do not mistake the running commentary in your mind (“Now I’m breathing in, now I’m breathing out”) for mindfulness. What is important is pure presence.	Don’t concentrate too much on the breath, give it about 25 percent of your attention, with the other 75 percent quietly and spaciously relaxed. As you become more mindful of your breathing, you will find that you become more and more present, gather all your scattered aspects back into yourself and become whole.

How could they be? We are still in samsara. Even when you are following the teachings as sincerely as you can you will meet difficulties and frustrations, contradictions and imperfections.

When someone is suffering and you find yourself at a loss to know how to help, put yourself unflinchingly in his or her place.

What would I most want from them?”	When you exchange yourself for others in this way, you are directly transferring your cherishing from its usual object, yourself, to other beings. So exchanging yourself for others is a very powerful way of loosening the hold on you of the self-cherishing and the self-grasping of ego, and so of releasing the heart of your compassion.

The sun and the moon are reflected in clear, still water instantly. Similarly, the blessings of all the buddhas are always present for those who have complete confidence in them. The sun’s rays fall everywhere uniformly, but only where they are focused through a magnifying glass can they set dry grass on fire. When the all-pervading rays of the Buddha’s compassion are focused through the magnifying glass of your faith and devotion the flame of blessings blazes up in your being. *~ Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche*

The teachings on the bardos, times of change and transformation, come from the wisdom mind of the buddhas who can see life and death like looking in the palms of their hands.

It is here and now that the preparation for the bardos that follow in this life and after it take place.

The Tibetan mystic, Tertön Sogyal, said that he was not really impressed by someone who could turn the floor into the ceiling or fire into water. A real miracle he said, was if someone could liberate a negative emotion.	The more often you listen to your discriminating awareness, the easier it will be to change your negative moods, see through them and even laugh at them for the absurd dramas and ridiculous illusions that they are. Gradually you will find yourself able to free yourself more and more quickly from dark emotions that may have ruled your life. The ability to do so is the greatest miracle of all.

There is an aspect of our minds that is its fundamental basis, a state Buddhist philosophers have called “the ground of the ordinary mind.” It functions like a storehouse, in which the imprints of past actions caused by our positive or negative emotions are stored like seeds. When the right conditions arise they germinate and manifest as circumstances and situations in our lives.	If we have a habit of thinking in a particular pattern, positive or negative, then these tendencies will be triggered very easily, and recur and go on recurring. With constant repetition our inclinations and habits become more entrenched, and continue increasing and gathering power, even when we sleep. This is how they come to determine our life, our death, and our rebirth. Rigpa Glimpse of the Day

We are in denial like children who cover their eyes in a game of hide and seek and think that no one can see them. Now in this precious human life is the time to prepare for the bardo of death which will take us on to our next life. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day/jg*

To meditate is to make a complete break with how we “normally” operate. It is a state free of all cares and concerns in which there is no competition, no desire to possess or grasp at anything, no intense and anxious struggle and no hunger to achieve. It is an ambitionless state where there is neither acceptance nor rejection, where there is no hope and no fear, where we release emotions and concepts that have imprisoned us and emerge into the space of natural simplicity. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Imagine you are sitting in front of a glass door that leads out into your garden looking through it gazing out into space. It seems as though there is nothing between you and the sky, because you cannot see the surface of the glass. You would bang your nose if you got up and tried to walk through, thinking it wasn’t there. But if you touch it you will see at once that there is something there that holds your fingerprints, something that comes between you and the space outside.	In the same manner the ground of the ordinary mind prevents us from breaking through to the skylike nature of our mind even if we can still have glimpses of it. We have to break out of the ground of the ordinary mind altogether to discover and let in the fresh air of Rigpa. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

When you practice, say you find yourself in a deep state of stillness; often it does not last very long as a thought or a movement arises, like a wave in the ocean. Don’t reject the movement or embrace the stillness but continue the flow of your pure presence. The pervasive, peaceful state of your meditation is the Rigpa itself and all risings are none other than this Rigpa’s self-radiance. This is the heart and the basis of Dzogchen practice.	One way to imagine this is as if you were riding on the sun’s rays back to the sun: You trace the risings back to their very root, the ground of Rigpa. As you embody the steadfast stability of the View you are no longer deceived or distracted by whatever rises and so cannot fall prey to delusion.

Remaining in the clarity and confidence of Rigpa allows all your thoughts and emotions to liberate naturally and effortlessly within its vast expanse, like writing in water, or painting in the sky.

Dudjom Rinpoche used to say that a beginner should practice meditation in short sessions. Practice for four or five minutes, then take a short break of just one minute. During the break, let go of the method, but do not let go of your mindfulness altogether.	Sometimes when you have been struggling to practice, curiously, the very moment when you take a break from the method—if you are still mindful and present—is the moment when meditation actually happens. That is why the break is just as important a part of meditation as the sitting itself. Sometimes I tell my students who are having problems with their practice to practice during the break and take a break during their meditation!

Dudjom Rinpoche says of the moment when Rigpa is directly revealed: “That moment is like taking a hood off your head. What boundless spaciousness and relief! This is the supreme seeing: seeing what was not seen before.” When you “see what was not seen before,” everything opens, expands, and becomes crisp, clear, brimming with life, vivid with wonder and freshness. It is as if the roof of your mind were dying off, or a flock of birds suddenly took off from a dark nest. All limitations dissolve and fall away, as if, the Tibetans say, a seal were broken open.

Our body is the center of our whole universe. We associate it without thinking with our self and our ego and this thoughtless and false association continually reinforces our illusion of their inseparable concrete existence. Because our body seems so convincingly to exist, our “I” seems to exist, and “you” seem to exist, and the entire illusory dualistic world we never stop projecting around us looks solid and real.	When we die, this whole compound construction falls dramatically to pieces. According to the teachings a subtle part of our consciousness remains and passes on to another existence.

The spiritual journey is one of continuous learning and purification. When you know this, you become humble.

What should we “do” with the mind in meditation? Nothing at all. Just leave it, simply, as it is.

Only then will we be prepared for the time when it reveals itself spontaneously and powerfully at the moment of death and be able to recognize it “as naturally,” the teachings say, “as a child running into its mother’s lap” and by remaining in that state, finally attain liberation. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Our lives are a perpetual fluctuation of birth, death, and transition. The transitions between our lives and deaths and births in Tibetan Buddhism are known as bardo experiences or moments of change. Between birth and death moments of change and transition or bardo experiences are also happening to us all the time. Every moment of our experience is a bardo as each thought and emotion arises out of and dies back into the essence of mind.	We may be oblivious to the bardos and their gaps as our mind passes from one seemingly solid situation to the next ignoring the transitions. In moments of change we may however become aware of the transitions and if we recognise the impermanent nature of all phenomena the skylike primordial nature of our mind may be able to manifest.

Just as clouds can be shifted by a strong gust of wind to reveal the shining sun and wide-open sky, some inspiration may uncover glimpses of this nature of mind. These glimpses have many depths and degrees, but each of them brings the light of understanding, meaning and freedom. The essential nature of mind, the unborn awareness that we share with all living beings, is the essence of understanding. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Where exactly is our buddha nature? It is in the skylike nature of our mind. Utterly open, free and limitless, it is fundamentally so simple and so natural that it can never be complicated, corrupted, or stained, so pure that it is beyond even the concept of purity and impurity.	To talk of this nature of mind as skylike is a metaphor that helps us to begin to imagine its all-embracing boundlessness.

Each time you breathe out, and before you breathe in again, you will find that there is a natural gap, as your grasping dissolves. Rest in that gap, in that open space.

Give it about 25 percent of your attention with the other 75 percent quietly and spaciously relaxed. As you become more mindful of your breathing you will find that you become more and more present, gather all your scattered aspects back into yourself and become whole. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Although we have been made to believe that if we let go we will end up with nothing, life reveals that letting go is the path to real freedom. When the waves lash at the shore, the rocks suffer no damage but are sculpted and eroded into beautiful shapes. Our characters can be molded and our rough edges worn smooth by changes. Through weathering changes we can learn to develop a gentle but unshakable composure. Our confidence in ourselves grows and becomes so much greater that goodness and compassion begin naturally to radiate out from us and bring joy to others. That goodness is what survives death, a fundamental goodness that is in each and every one of us. The whole of our life is a teaching of how to uncover that strong goodness, and a training toward realizing it. *~ Sogyal Rinpoche.*

Because in our culture we overvalue the intellect we imagine that to become enlightened demands extraordinary intelligence. In fact, many kinds of cleverness are just further obscurations. There is a Tibetan saying: “If you are too clever, you could miss the point entirely.” Patrul Rinpoche said: “The logical mind seems interesting, but it is the seed of delusion.” People can become obsessed with their own theories and miss the point of everything. In Tibet we say: “Theories are like patches on a coat, one day they just wear off.” Our natural mind which is enlightened is with us all the time. It was never born and never dies.

The real glory of meditation lies not in any method but in its continual living experience of presence, in its bliss, clarity, peace and, most important of all complete absence of grasping. The diminishing of your grasping is a sign that you are becoming freer of yourself. The more you experience this freedom, the clearer the sign that the ego and the hopes and fears that keep it alive are dissolving and the closer you will come to the infinitely generous wisdom of egolessness. When you live in that wisdom home, you’ll no longer find a barrier between “I” and “you,” “this” and “that,” “inside” and “outside”; you’ll have come finally, to your true home, the state of nonduality. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

To recognize the nature of your mind is to engender in the ground of your being an understanding that will change your entire worldview and help you discover and develop, naturally and spontaneously, a compassionate desire to serve all beings, as well as a direct knowledge of how best you can do so, with whatever skill or ability you have, in whatever circumstances you find yourself. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Tibet’s famous poet-saint Milarepa, said: “My religion is to live—and die—without regret. “ Reflecting on what life and death mean and the laws of dependent arising, karma and impermanence and practicing bodhicitta love and an ethical life can enable us to make rich use of this life while we still have time. While we live and when we die it will be without regret or recrimination at having wasted our lives. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day paraphrased*

The moment of death is a tremendous opportunity if we understand clearly what is happening and have prepared well for it in life. At the actual moment of death the thinking ego-mind dies into the essence, and in this truth, enlightenment takes place. If we familiarize ourselves with the true nature of mind through practice while we are alive we become prepared for when it reveals itself spontaneously at the moment of death. Recognition then follows as naturally as a child running into its mother’s lap. Remaining in that state, we are liberated. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Offer up every joy, be awake at all moments, to “the news that is always arriving out of silence.” You are the master of your own bliss, a chemist of your own joy, with all sorts of remedies always at hand to elevate, cheer, illuminate, and inspire your every breath and movement. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

The teachings on the bardos (different periods in existence) come from the wisdom mind of the buddhas, who can see life and death like looking in the palms of their hands. We too are buddhas. So if we can practice in the bardo of this life, and go deeper and deeper into the nature of our mind, then we can discover this knowledge of the bardos, and the truth of these teachings will unfold in us by itself. That is why the natural bardo of this life is of the utmost importance. It is here and now that the whole preparation for all the bardos takes place. “The supreme way of preparing,” it is said, “is now—to become enlightened in this lifetime”. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

If your mind is able to settle naturally of its own accord and you are inspired simply to rest in its pure awareness then you do not need any method of meditation. However the majority of us find it difficult to arrive at that state straight away. We simply do not know how to awaken it. Our minds are so wild and so distracted that we need a skillful means or method to evoke it.	By “skillful” I mean that you bring together your understanding of the essential nature of your mind, your knowledge of your various shifting moods, and the insight you have developed through your practice into how to work with yourself from moment to moment. By bringing these together you learn the art of applying whatever method is appropriate to any particular situation or problem, to transform that environment of your mind. *~ Sogyal Rinpoche*

When someone is suffering and you find yourself at a loss to know how to help, put yourself unflinchingly in his or her place. Imagine as vividly as possible what you would be going through if you were suffering the same pain. Ask yourself: “How would I feel? How would I want my friends to treat me? What would I most want from them?” When you exchange yourself for others in this way, you are directly transferring your cherishing from its usual object, yourself, to other beings. So exchanging yourself for others is a very powerful way of loosening the hold on you of the self-cherishing and the selfi-grasping of ego, and so of releasing the heart of your compassion. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

A term such as meditation is not really appropriate for Dzogchen practice, you can see, as ultimately it implies meditating “on” something, whereas in Dzogchen all is only and forever Rigpa.

Because life is nothing but a perpetual fluctuation of birth, death, and transition, so bardo experiences are happening to us all the time, and are a basic part of our psychological makeup. Normally, however, we are oblivious to the bardos and their gaps, as our mind passes from one so-called solid situation to the next, habitually ignoring the transitions that are always occurring.	In fact, as the teachings can help us to understand, every moment of our experience is a bardo, as each thought and each emotion arises out of, and dies back into, the essence of mind. It is in moments of strong change and transition especially, the teachings make us aware, that the true skylike, primordial nature of mind will have a chance to manifest.

However desperate you become, accept your pain as it is, because it is in fact trying to hand you a priceless gift: the chance of discovering, through spiritual practice, what lies behind sorrow.	“Grief,” Rumi wrote, “can be the garden of compassion. If you keep your heart open through everything, your pain can become your greatest ally in your life’s search for love and wisdom.”

The teachings of all the great mystical paths of the world make it clear that there is within us an enormous reservoir of power, the power of wisdom and compassion, the power of what Christ called the Kingdom of Heaven. If we learn how to use it—and this is the goal of the search for enlightenment—it can transform not only ourselves but the world around us. Has there ever been a time when the clear use of this sacred power was more essential or more urgent? Has there ever been a time when it was more vital to understand the nature of this pure power and how to channel it and how to use it for the sake of the world? *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

If you try to subdue your selfish motives—anger and so forth—and develop more kindness and compassion for others, ultimately you yourself will benefit more than you would otherwise. So sometimes I say that the wise selfish person should practice this way. Foolish selfish people are always thinking of themselves, and the result is negative. Wise selfish people think of others, help others as much as they can, and the result is that they too receive benefit. *~ Dalai Lama*

Don’t impose anything on your mind. When you meditate make no effort to control and no attempt to be peaceful. Don’t be solemn or feel that you are taking part in some ritual. Let go of the idea that you are meditating. Let your body remain as it is and your breath as you find it. You are the sky holding the whole universe. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day paraphrased*

There would be no chance at all of getting to know death if it happened only once. But fortunately, life is nothing but a continuing dance of birth and death, a dance of change. Every time you hear the rush of a mountain stream, or the waves crashing on the shore, or your own heartbeat, hear the sound of impermanence. These changes, these small deaths, are our living links with death. They are death’s pulses, death’s heartbeat, prompting us to let go of all the things we cling to. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day paraphrased*

Buddha taught that ignorance of our true nature is the root of samsara and the root of ignorance is the mind’s habitual tendency to distraction.	To end the mind’s distraction is to end samsara. The way to this is to bring the mind home to its true nature through meditation.

If meditation in Dzogchen is simply to continue the flow of Rigpa, how do we know when it is Rigpa and when it is not? I asked Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche this question, and he replied with his characteristic simplicity: “If you are in an unaltered state, it is Rigpa.”	If we are not contriving or manipulating the mind in any way, but simply resting in an unaltered state of pure and pristine awareness, that is Rigpa. If there is any contriving on our part or any kind of manipulating or grasping, it is not. Rigpa is a state in which there is no longer any doubt; there is not really a mind to doubt: you see directly. If you are in this state, a complete, natural certainty and confidence surge up with the Rigpa itself, and that is how you know. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Looking into death needn’t be frightening or morbid. Why not reflect on death when you are really inspired, relaxed, and comfortable, lying in bed, or on vacation, or listening to music that particularly delights you? Why not reflect on it when you are happy, in your good health, confident, and full of well-being? Don’t you notice that there are particular moments when you are naturally inspired to introspection? Work with them gently, for these are the moments when you can go through a powerful experience, and your whole worldview can change quickly. These are the moments when former beliefs crumble jon their own, and you can find yourself being transformed.	*~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

As you continue to practice meditation, you may have all kinds of experiences, both good and bad. You might experience states of bliss, clarity, or absence of thoughts. In one way these are very good experiences, and signs of progress in meditation. For when you experience bliss, it’s a sign that desire has temporarily dissolved. When you experience real clarity, it’s a sign that aggression has temporarily ceased. When you experience a state of absence of thought, it’s a sign that your ignorance has temporarily died. By themselves they are good experiences, but if you get attached to them, they become obstacles.	Experiences are not realization in themselves; but if we remain free of attachment to them, they become what they really are—that is, materials for realization. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

The times when you are suffering can be those when you are open, and where you are extremely vulnerable can be where your greatest strength really lies.	Say to yourself: “I am not going to run away from this suffering. I want to use it in the best and richest way I can, so that I can become more compassionate and more helpful to others.” Suffering, after all, can teach us about compassion. If you suffer, you will know how it is when others suffer. And if you are in a position to help others, it is through your suffering that you will find the understanding and compassion to do so. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

In meditation, be at ease, be as natural and spacious as possible.	Slip quietly out of the noose of your habitual anxious self, release all grasping, and relax into your true nature. Think of your ordinary, emotional, thought-ridden self as a block of ice or a slab of butter left out in the sun. If you are feeling hard and cold, let this aggression melt away in the sunlight of your meditation. Let peace work on you and enable you to gather your scattered mind into the mindfulness of Calm Abiding, and awaken in you the awareness and insight of Clear Seeing. And you will find all your negativity disarmed, your aggression dissolved, and your confusion evaporating slowly like mist into the vast and stainless sky of your absolute nature. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Quietly sitting, body still, speech silent, mind at peace, let thoughts and emotions, whatever rises, come and go, without clinging to anything.	What does this state feel like? Dudjom Rinpoche used to say: Imagine a man who comes home after a long, hard day’s work in the fields, and sinks into his favorite chair in front of the fire. He has been working all day and he knows that he has achieved what he wanted to achieve; there is nothing more to worry about, nothing left unaccomplished, and he can let go completely of all his cares and concerns, content, simply, to be. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

The practice of mindfulness defuses our negativity, aggression, and turbulent emotions, which may have been gathering power over many lifetimes. Rather than suppressing emotions or indulging in them, here it is important to view them—your thoughts and whatever arises—with an acceptance and generosity that are as open and spacious as possible. Tibetan masters say that this wise generosity has the flavor of boundless space, so warm and cozy that you feel enveloped and protected by it, as if by a blanket of sunlight. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Dudjom Rinpoche says of the moment when Rigpa is directly revealed: “That moment is like taking a hood off your head. What boundless spaciousness and relief! This is the supreme seeing: seeing what was not seen before.” When you “see what was not seen before,” everything opens, expands, and becomes crisp, clear, brimming with life, vivid with wonder and freshness. It is as if the roof of your mind were dying off, or a flock of birds suddenly took off from a dark nest. All limitations dissolve and fall away, as if, the Tibetans say, a seal were broken open. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

Whatever thoughts and emotions arise in meditation, allow them to rise and settle, like the waves in the ocean. Whatever you find yourself thinking, let that thought rise and settle, without any constraint. Don’t grasp at it, feed it, or indulge it, don’t cling to it, and don’t try to solidify it. Neither follow thoughts nor invite them; be like the ocean looking at its own waves, or the sky gazing down on the clouds that pass across it.	You will soon find that thoughts are like the wind; they come and go. The secret is not to “think” about the thoughts but to allow them to flow through your mind, while keeping your mind free of afterthoughts.

It is essential to realize now, in life, when we still have a body, that its convincing appearance of solidity is a mere illusion. The most powerful way to realize this is to learn how, after meditation, to “become a child of illusion”: to refrain from solidifying, as we are always tempted to do, the perceptions of ourselves and our world; and to go on, like the “child of illusion,” seeing directly, as we do in meditation, that all phenomena are illusory and dreamlike. The realization that this deepens the body’s illusory nature is one of the most profound and inspiring we can have to help us to let go. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day.*

Imagine you were living in a house on the top of a mountain which was itself at the top of the whole world. Suddenly the entire structure of the house, which limited your view, just falls away and you can see all around you, both outside and inside.

This is how it feels when Rigpa is directly revealed. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

We often wonder what to do about negativity or certain troubling emotions. In the spaciousness of meditation, you can view your thoughts and emotions with a totally unbiased attitude. When your attitude changes, then the whole atmosphere of your mind changes, even the very nature of your thoughts and emotions.

When we are in a negative frame of mind, it is only natural to doubt rather than to believe. From a Buddhist point of view, doubt is a sign of a lack of complete understanding and a lack of spiritual education, but it is also seen as a catalyst in the maturing of faith. It is when we face doubts and difficulties that we discover whether our faith is a simplistic, pious, and conceptual one, or whether it is strong, enduring, and anchored in a deep understanding in the heart.If you have faith, sooner or later it may well be put to the test, and wherever the challenge may come from—from within you or from outside—it is simply part of the process of faith and doubt. *~  Rigpa Glimpse of the day*

The whole point of Dzogchen meditation practice is to strengthen and stabilize Rigpa and allow it to grow to full maturity. The ordinary, habitual mind with its projections is extremely powerful. It keeps returning, and takes hold of us easily when we are inattentive or distracted.

Even in the greatest yogi, sorrow and joy still arise just as before. The difference between an ordinary person and the yogi is how they view their emotions and react to them.

A yogi, however, perceives everything that rises in its natural, pristine state, without allowing grasping to enter his perception. *~ Rigpa thought of the day.*

All the Buddhist teachings are explained in terms of Ground, Path, and Fruition. The ground of Dzogchen is the fundamental, primordial state, our absolute nature, which is already perfect and always present. Patrul Rinpoche says: “It is neither to be sought externally, nor is it something you did not have before and that now has to be newly born in your mind.” So from the point of view of the Ground—the absolute—our nature is the same as the buddhas’, and there is no question at this level, “not a hair’s breadth,” the masters say, of teaching or practice to do. *~ Rigpa Thought of the Day.*

The Dzogchen masters are acutely aware of the dangers of confusing the absolute with the relative. People who fail to understand this relationship can overlook and even disdain the relative aspects of spiritual practice and the karmic law of cause and effect. However, those who truly seize the meaning of Dzogchen will have only a deeper respect for karma, as well as a keener and more urgent appreciation of the need for purification and for spiritual practice. This is because they will understand the vastness of what it is in them that has been obscured, and so endeavor all the more fervently, and with an always fresh, natural discipline, to remove whatever stands between them and their true nature. *~ Rigpa Thought of the Day.*

A human being is part of a whole, called by us the ‘Universe,’ a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest—a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.

Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. *~ Albert Einstein*

An effortless compassion can arise for all beings who have not realized their true nature. So limitless is it that if tears could express it, you would cry without end. Not only compassion, but tremendous skillful means can be born when you realize the nature of mind. Also you are naturally liberated from all suffering and fear, such as the fear of birth, death and the intermediate state. Then if you were to speak of the joy and bliss that arise from this realization, it is said by the buddhas that if you were to gather all the glory, enjoyment, pleasure and happiness of the world and put it all together, it would not approach one tiny fraction of the bliss that you experience upon realizing the nature of mind. *~ Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche*

What is the nature of mind like? Imagine a sky, empty, spacious, and pure from the beginning; its essence is like this. Imagine a sun, luminous, clear, unobstructed, and spontaneously present; its nature is like this. Imagine that sun shining out impartially on us and all things, penetrating all directions; its energy, which is the manifestation of compassion, is like this: Nothing can obstruct it, and it pervades everywhere. *~ Rigpa Glimpse o the Day*

If you are sitting, and your mind is not wholly in tune with your body—if you are, for instance, anxious or preoccupied with something—your body will experience physical discomfort, and difficulties will arise more easily. Whereas if your mind is in a calm, inspired state, it will influence your whole posture, and you can sit much more naturally and effortlessly. So it is very important to unite the posture of your body and the confidence that arises from your realization of the nature of your mind. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

In Tibetan we call the essential nature of mind Rigpa—primordial, pure, pristine awareness that is at once intelligent, cognizant, radiant, and always awake. This nature of mind, its innermost essence, is absolutely and always untouched by change or death. At present it is hidden within our own mind, our sem, enveloped and obscured by the mental scurry of our thoughts and emotions. Just as clouds can be shifted by a strong gust of wind to reveal the shining sun and wide-open sky, so, under certain circumstances, some inspiration may uncover for us glimpses of this nature of mind. These glimpses have many depths and degrees, but each of them will bring some light of understanding, meaning and freedom. This is because the nature of mind is the very root itself of understanding. *~ Rigpa Glimpse of the Day*

One of the chief reasons we have so much anguish and difficulty in facing death is that we ignore the truth of impermanence.	In our minds, changes always equal loss and suffering. And if they come, we try to anesthetize ourselves as far as possible. We assume, stubbornly and unquestioningly, that permanence provides security and impermanence does not. But in fact impermanence is like some of the people we meet in life—difficult and disturbing at first, but on deeper acquaintance far friendlier and less unnerving than we could have imagined. *~ Rigpa Thought of the Day*

Loss and bereavement can remind you sharply of what can happen when in life you do not show your love and appreciation, or ask for forgiveness, and so make you far more sensitive to your loved ones.	Elisabeth Kubler-Ross said: ‘What I try to teach people is to live in such a way that you say those things while the other person can still hear it.” And Raymond Moody, after his life’s work in near-death research, wrote: “I have begun to realize how near to death we all are in our daily lives. More than ever now I am very careful to let each person I love know how I feel.” *~ Rigpa Thought of the Day.*

Once you have the View, although the delusory perceptions of samsara may arise in your mind, you will be like the sky; when a rainbow appears in front of it, it’s not particularly flattered, and when the clouds appear it’s not particularly disappointed either. There is a deep sense of contentment. You chuckle from inside as you see the facade of samsara and nirvana; the View will keep you constantly amused, with a little inner smile bubbling away all the time. *~ Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche*

A woman who went through a near-death experience reported a startling range of aftereffects and changes.	The things that I felt slowly were a very heightened sense of love, the ability to communicate love, the ability to find joy and pleasures in the smallest and most insignificant things about me.... I developed a great compassion for people that were ill and facing death and I wanted so much to let them know, to somehow make them aware that the dying process was nothing more than an extension of one’s life.

Ask yourself these two questions: Do I remember at every moment that I am dying, and that everyone and everything else is, and so treat all beings at all times with compassion? Has my understanding of death and impermanence become so keen and so urgent that I am devoting every second to the pursuit of enlightenment? If you can answer “yes” to both of these, then you really understand impermanence. *~ Rigpa Thought of the Day*

If meditation in Dzogchen is simply to continue the flow of Rigpa after the introduction by the master, how do we know when it is Rigpa and when it is not? I asked Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche this question, and he replied with his characteristic simplicity: “If you are in an unaltered state, it is Rigpa.”	If we are not contriving or manipulating the mind in any way, but simply resting in an unaltered state of pure and pristine awareness, that is Rigpa. If there is any contriving on our part or any kind of manipulating or grasping, it is not. Rigpa is a state in which there is no longer any doubt; there is not really a mind to doubt: we see directly. If we are in this state, a complete, natural certainty and confidence surge up with the Rigpa itself, and that is how we know. *~ Sogyal Rinpoche*

Fundamentally, there is just open space, the basic ground, what we really are. Our most fundamental state of mind, before the creation of ego, is such that there is basic openness, basic freedom, a spacious quality; and we have now and have always had this openness. *~ Chogyam Trungpa*

The purpose of meditation is to awaken in us the skylike nature of mind, and to introduce us to that which we really are, our unchanging pure awareness that underlies the whole of life and death.	In the stillness and silence of meditation, we glimpse and return to that deep inner nature that we so long ago lost sight of amid the busyness and distraction of our minds.

Sometimes when I meditate, I don’t use any particular method. I just allow my mind to rest, and I find, especially when I am inspired, that I can bring my mind home and relax very quickly. I sit quietly and rest in the nature of mind; I don’t question or doubt whether I am in the “correct” state. There is no effort, only a rich understanding, wakefulness, and unshakable certainty.	When I am in the nature of mind, the ordinary mind is no longer there. There is no need to sustain or confirm a sense of being: I simply am. A fundamental trust is present. There is nothing in particular to do.

When the wisdom of Rigpa (Buddha mind) shines, a growing sense of tremendous and unshakable certainty and conviction that “this is it” rises up: There is nothing further to seek, nothing more that could possibly be hoped for. This certainty of the View is what has to be deepened through glimpse after glimpse of the nature of mind, and stabilized through the continuous discipline of meditation

The basis on which Buddhist[s] accept the concept of rebirth is principally the continuity of consciousness... If you trace our present mind or consciousness back, then you will find that you are tracing the origin of the continuity of mind into an infinite dimension; it is, as you will see, beginningless. Therefore there must be successive rebirths that allow that continuum of mind to be there. *~ The Dalai Lama*
{:.keep-together}

***

What should we “do” with the mind in meditation? Nothing at all.Just leave it, simply, as it is. One master described meditation as “mind, suspended in space, nowhere.” From Sogyal Rinpoche The mind is already enlightened. It is only negative thoughts and emotions and ego that obscure it. If a thought arises during meditation don't follow it. Just be aware of everything around you and in your breath and body and Rigpa or the enlightened state is there. The more you practice this the easier it will be to return to it. Rigpa or enlightenment is the gap between thoughts when there is total awareness. It can be found easily in nature, gazing at the horizon, walking by the sea. When it happens be aware of it and cherish it.

To meditate is to make a complete break with how we “normally” operate, for it is a state free of all cares and concerns, in which there is no competition, no desire to possess or grasp at anything, no intense and anxious struggle, and no hunger to achieve: an ambitionless state where there is neither acceptance nor rejection, neither hope nor fear, a state in which we slowly begin to release all those emotions and concepts that have imprisoned us into the space of natural simplicity. *~ Sogyal Rinpoche from Rigpa Glimpse of the Day.*

May 29 In meditation, be at ease, be as natural and spacious as possible.	Slip quietly out of the noose of your habitual anxious self, release all grasping, and relax into your true nature. Think of your ordinary, emotional, thought-ridden self as a block of ice or a slab of butter left out in the sun. If you are feeling hard and cold, let this aggression melt away in the sunlight of your meditation. Let peace work on you and enable you to gather your scattered mind into the mindfulness of Calm Abiding, and awaken in you the awareness and insight of Clear Seeing. And you will find all your negativity disarmed, your aggression dissolved, and your confusion evaporating slowly like mist into the vast and stainless sky of your absolute nature.

By the examination of his own thoughts emotions concepts and other activities of mind, the Buddha discovered that there is no need to struggle to prove our existence, that we need not be subject to the rules of the lords or forces of materialism. There is no need to struggle to be free; the absence of struggle is in itself freedom. This egoless state is the attainment of Buddhahood. The process of transforming the material mind from expressions of the egos ambition into expressions of basic sanity through the practice of meditation – this might be said to be the true spiritual path. *~ Chogyam Trungpa.*

Three steps to eliminating the effects of negative thoughts and emotions and reducing the propensity for them to arise. 1. Determination. I am determined not to embrace deluded mind which leads to negative thoughts and emotions 2. Reproachment. If negative thoughts or emotions do arise I reproach myself for allowing them. 3. Aspiration. I aspire to always be mindful of the arising of negative thoughts and emotions and to immediately face and avert them. I will strive to foster unrisen positive thoughts & emotions to and maintain the positive thoughts & emotions that have already arisen. This is part of 'RIGHT EFFORT' according to the 'Noble 8-fold Path'.

To be free of pervasive suffering be constantly aware of the undesirability of disturbing emotions. When you eliminate them you will gain Nivarna or liberation. Anything impermanent disintegrates and changes every moment. Even an omniscient mind is impermanent and disintegrates moment by moment. Impermanent phenomena have no independent identity and are under the influence of other factors such as causes and conditions. As such, pervasive suffering does not remain constant even for a moment, but is in a steady process of disintegration and change. Meditate on compassion at all times, focusing on all sentient beings and wishing that they all be free of suffering. *~ Dalai Lama - Stages of Meditation*

THE TRAFFIC OF YOUR THOUGHTS	While you’re meditating, all kinds of thoughts arise. All kinds of things come through the mind. Let them just come through. Don’t try to say whether they are bad or for that matter particularly good. Just let them come through, as simply as you can. By letting them come through, you find that there’s a sense of openness. You don’t find your thoughts threatening or particularly helpful. They just become the general gossip of your thoughts. This traffic of your thoughts and the verbosity of your mind are simply part of the basic chatter that goes on in the universe. Just let it go through.
